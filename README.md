#*Bliep Hackathon

Code repo for *Bliep Hackathon. We're creating an Android app and an iOS app.

###Cloning Code:
iOS makes use of 3rd party libraries. We're keeping those up to date with git's submodules. When cloning, make sure you clone recursive to include submodules:

`git clone --recursive git@github.com:nicolasbrailo/bliep_hackathon.git`
